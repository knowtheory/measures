Measures is, oddly enough, a measurement library.

It is currently pre-alpha, but available for people to look at.

My goal for measures is type checking for measurement units, and safe accurate conversion between them.  The initial seed target is the System International (metric), but my own needs will require US Customary Units (us imperial) eventually.

Sample goals:

>> 4.kilometres 
# => returns a Metre object w/ value 4 kilometres

>> 4.kilometres.convert_to("meters") 
# => returns a Metre object w/ value 4000 metres

>> 4.kilometres.convert_to("meters") / 20.seconds
# => returns a ComplexMeasure object w/ value 200 metres per second
