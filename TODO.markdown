Dealing with ambiguity:

There are a number of ambiguous inputs, which unfortunately i'm not entirely sure how to deal with.  While the metric system is only sort of ambiguous, any sort of extensible system is just going to explode when dealing with the possible ambiguities.  It's paramount that measures are identified properly.

mm 	  => millimeter
meter => meter		# NOT millieter
